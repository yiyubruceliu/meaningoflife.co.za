            <h3>The adventure</h3>

            <p>
              With my scarf rapped around my neck, I walked into the old lab in
              which I use to be the person that opens the labs so I have the
              keys and the door code to enter.
            </p>

            <p>
              I dropped all of bags on the table and lightly placed my glass
              bottle on the table. This reminds me of my final year project days
              when we use to fight the war. However, my mind was quite occupied
              with the work that I needed to complete, so I headed on.
            </p>

            <p>
              After a couple of pages into my textbook, I laid back into my
              seat. Dropped my back rest and slide down so that my head can rest
              on the top of the seat. Now I started to feel my surroundings and
              my memories started to drip in bit by bit.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first time, I took
              <a href=""TheWhatsAppStatus.html"">Apple</a> into this lab was the
              first day that our fire of affinity started to burn. That day was
              so unexpected. I remember that morning to also be really cold…
              this is what happened that day…
            </p>

            <p>
              I was walking back from the small coffee shop around the corner to
              the building of the labs when I decided to take a sneaky route. On
              the way, I heard someone call my name
            </p>

            <p>
              I was surprised to hear anyone call my name during this time of
              the morning. It was around 6:45am. I am always that early bird
              because of my distance from home.
            </p>

            <p>
              So I turned around to see this long silky haired girl and short,
              calling me. It was obviously Apple. We knew each other since high
              school when we use to play chess. So I greeted her back with a hug
              and said "Good morning"
            </p>

            <p>
              So she told me that it is interesting because she never knew about
              this route that I am about to take even though she has been around
              for awhile now.
            </p>

            <p>
              So we hopped along to my labs. I found it somewhat interesting
              that she followed me all the way to my labs. It was very
              unexpected but because she did that, I found it a lot easier to
              converse with her. I am a person that really doesn’t mind awkward
              moments. I tend to just go with the flow and then evaluate for
              myself later how I feel about the situation that just passed. I
              opened the security steel gate. With one hand on the handle of the
              door and my body leaned against the door, I told her that it’s a
              bit messy. Then I opened the door as she answered "Its ok" She
              gazed around and told me that it isn’t actually messy at all.
            </p>

            <p>
              I showed her around to the room. Pointed out where the foosball
              table was, where we would normally sit to work. We ended up
              standing at the front of the room. I can’t really remember if I
              got her number that day or not but from day day onwards, I had her
              number. The last thing I did with her that day was walking her
              out.
            </p>

            <h3>My Thoughts</h3>

            <p>
              This is when my feelings took me back to the initial "happy
              feeling" when I saw her for the first time. I started taking an
              objective perspective of this situation to see what it actually is
              that is happening to my psychological self.
            </p>

            <p>
              Why was I missing her? What makes me feel like I miss her? I came
              to the realisation that the things around me is stimulating the
              memory that I have of her. Which is then bringing up the feeling I
              have about her. Then the next set of questions started to pop up
              in my mind. Why are these things causing my brain to bring back
              such memories? Such feelings?
            </p>

            <p>
              It seems like people tend to remember feelings a lot stronger than
              logical procedures of action. Feelings and emotions has a deeper
              meaning to us than anything else. Which starts to make sense why a
              lot of people cannot let go of different objects in their lives
              because of the memories they hold onto. Some people have their
              grand parent’s ashes strapped around their neck. Some people kept
              their childhood teddy bear that is already been stripped into
              pieces steadily placed on their top shelf. Fascinatingly, these
              objects tell us a lot about their emotional journey that they have
              been through.
            </p>

            <p>
              People are emotional beings that get attached to events. Objects
              in our lives remind us of our feelings that we had when we were
              going through such experiences.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thinking about this concept, I started to evaluate people around
              me. I seem to see a lot of people who base their actions on their
              accumulated emotions about someone. These accumulations all start
              from the first impression of someone.
            </p>

            <p>
              When we are already angry with someone, it makes it really
              difficult to continue the conversation whenever we have to
              communicate with them. I can relate to that a lot in my life. The
              same can be applied to a lot of scenarios in my friends lives.
              What I seem to find interesting about this is that it is actually
              really hard to let go of the emotions we use to have about someone
              and face them as a totally new person. Even if the person has
              completely changed, we will still grip onto a lot of those
              emotions that we unravelled with the person.
            </p>

            <p>
              When the scripts say that we should keep our enemies closer than
              our friends, we basically failing to do that every time we meet
              someone that we hate. We need to let go. We need to let go of our
              attachments. We need to give people a chance. We need to forgive
              people. We need to treat everyone like the creation of God.
            </p>

            <p>
              These statements are easy to say, yet so difficult to do.
              Especially during the interaction with that particular person that
              burns your flames of anger. Can we respect someone that we hate?
              Can we respect someone that frustrates us? Can we forgive someone
              that hurt us before? Can we love someone just like how God loves
              us?
            </p>

            <p>
              I am sure this ocean will let me know the meaning of life once I
              am ready for it…
            </p>
