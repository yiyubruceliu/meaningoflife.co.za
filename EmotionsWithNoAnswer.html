Quite a shame isn’t it? I have been working on a blog post that will hit the topic on "what is the meaning of life?"</p> <p>I want that post to be somewhat of a master piece. Taking into the consideration that it hits the topic. However, working life is taking over my time to gather resources so I am still on a hold for that. But now, I’m going to build up the climax for all you readers to keep an aware out for this post ^_^. It is going to be fantastic. I doing my homework for this.</p> <p>In the meantime, I decided to speak about emotions. <strong>Do you have emotional problems? </strong> I think that is a simple question to answer yet a tough battle to fight, isn’t it?</p> <p>I have been going through some of these myself. The days went by without me even knowing what has happened during those times. I sure do know one thing though, I baggage a lot of emotions with me throughout this time.</p> <p>What kind of emotions can a person carry with them though?</p> <p>Anger? Loneliness? A feeling of non-acceptance? A fear of failure? Scared to say something wrong? Frustrated with your surroundings? Falling in love? Heart broken? Being overly joyful?</p> <p>Well, there is a lot more than what I have mentioned. Although, those are actually emotions I have been going through.</p> <p>Today, while I was slouching on the couch in my our office… yes, we have couches in our office. The office is shared by seven people with two extra small couches and a coffee table. So back to today. Today, while I was slouching on the couch in my office all silently while some other staff members were talking about YouTube and all sorts of life events, I realised something. I was dealing with emotions. Playing with my phone to try and stay normal. Looking at my computer once in awhile.</p> <p>One of the girls is a girl that pays attention to details. She has such a lovable personality. Her extroverted personality really does try to make sure everyone is happy. So she asked me "hay, are you ok? You have been quite phased today" while I was staring at the clock at the back of the office. I turned my head to look at her and turned back to the clock. I didn’t say a thing. Was I ok?</p> <p>My eyes started to boil, chest started to sink. What is wrong with me?</p> <h3>My Thoughts</h3> <p>Sitting here calmly at home, I thought to myself … what is going on? Am I stressed?</p> <p>I think sometimes, figuring out what it actually is that is causing you to have such an emotional turbulence is the tough part. There is even a chance that it is just … everything throwing rocks at you at the same time!</p> <p>Then I started to think about the people in my life. Is it just me that is going through such a horrible time? No. it looks like there is actually quite some people going through the same problems in life.</p> <p>However, regardless of whether I’ve figured out my problem or not, I thank God for giving me the chance to have such supportive friends in my life. On the way home from the office, I apologised to Alex telling him that he shouldn’t have to go through the emotional ride with me. He replied by saying "Dude, you don't need to apologise. Just make sure you don't bottle up your emotions, cos I get that you want to feel neutral and at peace and stuff but you need to let yourself feel emotions when you need to - it's only human. Cos trust me, bottling shit up only makes it worse when it comes back agin."</p> <p>Alex surely might not be a saint, but I do appreciate him for being in my life. Truly finding friends that actually care for you makes a big difference when situations in life are getting tough. Taking that back one step … whether Alex is a saint or not, he will always feel like one in my heart. Best buds for life bro =P</p> <p>Until now, I still have no answer as to why I had emotional problems. I guess that is life leaving some room for uncertainty to keep things entertaining. So I do apologies if you wanted to kind out the mystery behind some emotional triggers. Maybe I’ll blog about that next time.</p> <p>If you guys liked my post, please share to let the world know Alex and his greatness ^_^</p> <div class="col-lg-12"> <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.meaningoflife.co.za%FEmotionsWithNoAnswer.html&width=450&layout=standard&action=like&show_faces=true&share=false&height=80&appId=812361508863971" width="400" height="80" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true"></iframe> </div> <hr> <div style="margin-top:30px" id="sharebuttons" class="text-center"> <h2 class="text-center">Share this page</h2> <span class="st_facebook_large" displaytext="Facebook"></span> <span class="st_twitter_large" displaytext="Tweet"></span> <span class="st_googleplus_large" displaytext="Google +"></span> <span class="st_linkedin_large" displaytext="LinkedIn"></span> <span class="st_pinterest_large" displaytext="Pinterest"></span> <span class="st_email_large" displaytext="Email"></span> <script>!function(e,t,a,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e.ga=e.ga||function(){(e.ga.q=e.ga.q||[]).push(arguments)},e.ga.l=1*new Date,o=t.createElement(a),s=t.getElementsByTagName(a)[0],o.async=1,o.src="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script",0,"ga"),ga("create","UA-39149944-2","auto"),ga("send","pageview"),function(e,t,a){var n,c=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];e.getElementById(a)||((n=e.createElement(t)).id=a,n.src="//connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.6&appId=812361508863971",c.parentNode.insertBefore(n,c))}(document,"script","facebook-jssdk");var e=!0;</script> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"></script> <script>stLight.options({publisher:"982523b1-f745-4da1-a991-53edadd4aa80",doNotHash:!1,doNotCopy:!1,hashAddressBar:!1});</script> </div> </div> <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"> <hr> <div class="fb-comments" data-href="https://www.meaningoflife.co.za/EmotionsWithNoAnswer.html" data-numposts="10"></div> </div> </div>  </article> <hr> <footer> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <h2 class="text-center">Follow me</h2> <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"> <ul class="list-inline text-center"> <li> <a href="https://twitter.com/@meaningoflife06"> <span class="fa-stack fa-lg"> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i> <i class="fab fa-twitter fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i> </span> </a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MeaningOfLife6/"> <span class="fa-stack fa-lg"> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i> <i class="fab fa-facebook fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i> </span> </a> </li> <li> <a href="https://plus.google.com/116140218948696801542" target="_blank"> <span class="fa-stack fa-lg"> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i> <i class="fa fa-google-plus fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i> </span> </a> </li> </ul> <p class="copyright text-muted">Copyright &copy; Meaning of Life 2016</p> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="/jquery.069f800f.js"></script> <script src="/bootstrap.min.e85e1c9b.js"></script> <script src="/clean-blog.min.2c2cf6dc.js"></script> </body></html>
