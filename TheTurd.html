            <h3>The Starting of the adventure</h3>

            <p>
              Ewww! What kind of topic will this bring us? What Meaning of Life
              can we find from a solid piece of turd? Well, it’s not really the
              turd itself that spark a thought in my mind. The turd, however,
              was a part of how I came to my conclusion though.
            </p>

            <p>
              Humans always seek to find a life that is better than their own.
              Starting from the comparison of themselves to the people
              surrounding them. This could pertain to any topic ranging from
              intelligence to finance. The question I use to have is "what sets
              us apart? How do I get what they have? It surely isn’t just hard
              work and dedication…". Recently, I had an experience that provoked
              a different way of thinking and, I think, it’s about to change my
              life.
            </p>

            <h3>Shopping time</h3>

            <p>
              It all began this one day when I decided to celebrate and relax a
              bit. I went to the Spar super market next door to me. While I was
              walking down this one row, I saw hot chocolate. Mind you, this is
              the middle of winter when it is freezing! With my eyes fixated on
              the hot chocolate, I shivered in coldness. I took a step back
              thinking to myself "I wonder how the most expensive one will taste
              like. It must be really good". Should I take it? Do I have enough
              money? Will I end up having enough money for the month? I probably
              shouldn’t take it. The rest of the food on my hand is already
              costing me quite some cash.
            </p>

            <p>
              So I walked out with hot chocolate… the most expensive one. I
              rushed home. Opened the door. Dropped my bag. Mug out. Kettle on.
              Opened the chocolate box… it was the tiniest portion of hot
              chocolate anyone can possible get. A box of Rooibos tea for R30
              would last me comfortably a month to a month and a half. This box
              of R55 would last me, sparingly, 10 days. Guess I’m going have to
              drink this hot chocolate like its heaven.
            </p>

            <p>
              … it surely was pleasing. I smiled with every sip of warm
              chocolate trickling down my throat. The pours on my skin was
              softened and my body was relaxed while endorphins flooded my body.
              Lovely!
            </p>

            <h3>Afternoon</h3>

            <p>
              After my 2 seconds of joy, I was back to the blazing winter,
              quivering in cold. As the day went by, the more I felt like my
              tummy was cramping. "I will be fine, I’m just cold"
            </p>

            <p>
              I’m on the toilet. I couldn’t help the pain that was intensifying
              in my intestines. It all came out. my lovely cup of hot chocolate
              decided to make its way out of my life so quickly. So uncommitted
              it was. Oh well.
            </p>

            <p>
              I stood up from my toilet seat and flushed the toilet. As I
              watched my turd get flushed away like a tadpole getting washed
              away by the waters of a river, a thought struck my mind. So this
              is the conclusion of my expensive cup of hot chocolate. What a
              waste.
            </p>

            <h3>My thoughts</h3>

            <p>
              All the luxuries of human life just end up becoming a piece of
              turd that gets flushed away. All our physical achievements of
              luxury gets detached from us when we pass away. Jacob Zuma will
              pass away without his expensive house.
            </p>

            <p>
              I grew up with some intelligence but not much financial freedom.
              Thinking as far into the future as always, my parents decided to
              take me to more of a well-known high school in the middle of the
              city. That is always where the financial freedom lies. It is most
              attractive site for sentimental beings. But because I lived so far
              away, I had to wake up at 5am every day to be at school to wake
              the sun up and come home after 6pm to say "good night" to the
              moon. I seriously needed a bar one chocolate for that extra hour a
              day. From this experience of hardship, it is really difficult not
              to become someone that constantly chases for the financial freedom
              that they ought to seek. I consider it a fear of being poor.
            </p>

            <p>
              Strangely, recently, I started hearing stories about successful
              people that has survived a similar hardship I have and started to
              get detrimental illnesses. Some have their eye removed for a brain
              tumour, some have 5 to 6 bottles of medications daily. But … they
              cannot let go of their own career in order to take care of their
              health … One of the easiest examples is Steve Jobs dying of a
              disease around the age of 55. He stood on stage marketing his
              product till the last possible day. It surely is that difficult to
              let go.
            </p>

            <p>
              There must be more to life than just physical success and I’m out
              to find it. It is time to let go of my physical success that I
              have built up from the past and time to start a new adventure to
              find something else that I will soon consider a success. I don’t
              want my success to become just a piece of solid turd …
            </p>
            <p>
              I am sure this ocean will let me know the meaning of life once I
              am ready for it…
            </p>
