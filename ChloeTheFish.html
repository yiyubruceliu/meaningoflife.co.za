                    <h3>Adventure</h3>
					<p>I spoke about Toby before, but I would like to speak about the person picking Toby up from the water. Why would I like to speak about this person? Because I think the mysteriousness comes from this person.</p>

					<p>In order for me to speak about this person, I would need to introduce another story. So there was once a fish called Chloe and she loved her dad a lot. Her dad was always her role model in the sense that her dad knew everything. I personally also look up to my dad because he has a lot of experience compared to me.</p>

					<p>So before I start with the story, I need us to understand this from the fish’s point of view. Even if fishes do not wear shoes, we should try put ourselves in Chloe’s shoes. </p>

					<p>So as Chloe started to slowly grow up, she was exposed to all the wonderful creatures in the world around her. She started to know about the other different types of fishes and the plants that grew on the ground.</p>

					<p>One day, she swam passed two fishes chattering to each other. Even though she has never seen these types of fishes, what rather interested was not the types of fishes they were, but rather the content of what they were chatting about. They were chatting about something mysterious and it started to make Chloe wonder herself: what is the mysterious object within the content of what they were saying. They mentioned this thing as “Water”.</p>

					<p>So Chloe swam back to her dad and asked her dad “Dad, what is water?”<br/>
					Chloe’s dad told her “Come closer”<br/>
					So Chloe swam closer.<br/>
					Chloe’s dad told her again “Come closer”<br/>
					So Chloe swam even closer.<br/>
					Chloe’s dad told her for the third time “Come closer”<br/>
					So Chloe swam even closer.</p>

					<p>Chloe’s dad then whispered in her ears as softly as possible “Water is all around you”</p>

					<h3>The person</h3>
					<p>Maybe one day Chloe would understand what this is, but for us, this person that is picking up Toby is all around us. This person is not a male or a female. This person is not really even a person. This person is merely a form of energy or a big bright light.</p>

					<p>Some people call this energy God, some call it the Universe, Ala, Buddha, Jesus or even Dao. There is a lot of names for this “Bright ball of energy”… I don’t really think we can place a name to “this” because the moment we do try giving it a name then the meaning of it changes and becomes your personal interpretations of it.</p>

					<h3>The energy</h3>
					<p>Sometimes, you can feel this energy. Sometimes, you know that it is communicating with you. Sometimes, you know exactly what it is telling you. Sometimes, you know why humans do exactly what they do because this energy is telling you why. But because it isn’t always and only sometimes, people tend to not find the communications between us and them. However, when you do find this channel, your world will change … Your perspective of your life will change. Your perspective of your friends’ life will change. Your perspective of everyone around you will change. But how do we strengthen this communication channel? That is want I want to speak about in my next post, so let me not spoil it :P</p>
					 
                    <p>I am sure this ocean will let me know the meaning of life once I am ready for it…</p>
