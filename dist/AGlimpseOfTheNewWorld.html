That topic had the perfect content for this article. Can you guess what the topic is? </p> <p>We spoke about Ghosts.</p> <p> Ghosts has always been a mystery to us as humans since we somehow cannot communicate with them through our personal human senses. It revolves around our minds as an uncertainty that we cannot comprehend. Whenever someone joyfully and proudly shares their journey of interacting with ghosts, I ponder about their experiences. Can it actually be true? </p> <p> So I did some research and started understanding a bit about the ghosts world and I want to solve some of these mysteries of yours from the limited understanding I have and the subjective perspective I see them as. </p> <p> This will be a great time to bring Toby, our little ant, back into the story ^_^. If you haven’t read about Toby, <a href="/Toby.html">click here to read his article.</a> </p> <p> Toby is a flat land creature. It cannot sense that you are above him and staring at him. When you place your finger slightly onto his back, he will get really shocked and start running around in circles like a crazy individual. Toby will start sharing this experience with all of his other friends. When we place our finger right in front of Toby when Toby is walking then all he can see is a slice of our finger. Toby cannot look up into the sky to see where this finger is coming from. The only thing Toby knows is that there is a giant skin looking object that appeared right in front of my eyes. </p> <p> The directions that Toby can walk is only front, back, left and right. Toby cannot go up or down. He might end up going up or down depending on the slop he is stepping on but he doesn’t recognise the fact that he is going up or down. </p> <p> Now let’s take Toby into a whole new experience. A spiritual journey, we will call it. We will pick Toby up and drop him. Now Toby starts to sail down from our fingers tips till the ground seeing pictures that he has never seen before. This is amazing and certainly breathe taking. We can surely say that he descended onto earth like a tadpole being washed away by the waters. Picture it and you will understand how Toby feels. Once Toby lands on the floor, he starts to tell all his "flat lander" friends his experience and he always starts off with saying "I cannot really explain what it is or how I feel about it, but …" </p> <p> The ellipses there is the stories and images Toby can explain to his friend like seeing the whole ground from above, which is crazy for his friends. Whenever we picture someone having been through that experience of seeing ghosts, we feel the same way Toby’s friends do. </p> <h3>Metaphorical comparison</h3> <p> All in all, it really is the same. Whenever someone trotters through a spiritual journey or "seeing" ghosts, it’s the same as Toby being lifted up and dropped onto earth again. </p> <p> So from that story we can see that the Ghosts are not necessarily evil. Sometimes they will hurt us accidentally because of the way they interact with us. A good comparison would be the fact that I squish Toby a little too hard when I pick him up. But at the same time, there are evil ghosts out there. Just like not discriminating race of humans, we shouldn’t do so with ghosts. But we should still be aware that there are some that really are there to squish Toby. </p> <p> So should we believe in ghosts? Should we hate them? Should we be afraid of them? Why can we not experience their world? What impact do they have with our lives? Will I become one of them one day? If their world exists then what is the meaning of mine? What is the meaning of my life in this small dimensional world of this never ending universe that doesn’t just have one dimension? </p>  <p> I am sure this ocean will let me know the meaning of life once I am ready for it… </p> <div class="col-lg-12"> <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.meaningoflife.co.za%FAGlimpseOfTheNewWorld.html&width=450&layout=standard&action=like&show_faces=true&share=false&height=80&appId=812361508863971" width="400" height="80" style="border:none;overflow:hidden;" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true"></iframe> </div> <hr> <div style="margin-top:30px;" id="sharebuttons" class="text-center"> <h2 class="text-center">Share this page</h2> <span class="st_facebook_large" displaytext="Facebook"></span> <span class="st_twitter_large" displaytext="Tweet"></span> <span class="st_googleplus_large" displaytext="Google +"></span> <span class="st_linkedin_large" displaytext="LinkedIn"></span> <span class="st_pinterest_large" displaytext="Pinterest"></span> <span class="st_email_large" displaytext="Email"></span> <script>!function(e,t,a,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e.ga=e.ga||function(){(e.ga.q=e.ga.q||[]).push(arguments)},e.ga.l=1*new Date,o=t.createElement(a),s=t.getElementsByTagName(a)[0],o.async=1,o.src="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script",0,"ga"),ga("create","UA-39149944-2","auto"),ga("send","pageview"),function(e,t,a){var n,c=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];e.getElementById(a)||((n=e.createElement(t)).id=a,n.src="//connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.6&appId=812361508863971",c.parentNode.insertBefore(n,c))}(document,"script","facebook-jssdk");var e=!0;</script> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"></script> <script>stLight.options({publisher:"982523b1-f745-4da1-a991-53edadd4aa80",doNotHash:!1,doNotCopy:!1,hashAddressBar:!1});</script> </div> </div> <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"> <hr> <div class="fb-comments" data-href="https://www.meaningoflife.co.za/AGlimpseOfTheNewWorld.html" data-numposts="10"></div> </div> </div> </div> </article> <hr> <footer> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <h2 class="text-center">Follow me</h2> <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"> <ul class="list-inline text-center"> <li> <a href="https://twitter.com/@meaningoflife06"> <span class="fa-stack fa-lg"> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i> <i class="fab fa-twitter fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i> </span> </a> </li> <li> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MeaningOfLife6/"> <span class="fa-stack fa-lg"> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i> <i class="fab fa-facebook fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i> </span> </a> </li>  </ul> <p class="copyright text-muted"> Copyright &copy; Meaning of Life 2016 </p> </div> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="/jquery.069f800f.js"></script> <script src="/bootstrap.min.e85e1c9b.js"></script> <script src="/clean-blog.min.2c2cf6dc.js"></script> </body></html>
