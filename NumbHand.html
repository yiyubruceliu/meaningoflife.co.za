            <h3>The adventure</h3>
            <p>
              I woke up in a horrifying shock one morning. It was 4am and I'm
              sweating with fear. Lying warmly under my thick blanket but only
              one arm could feel it. Something happened to me during my sleep
              ... That something kept me thinking until today ... That something
              changed my perspective of life.
            </p>
            <p>
              This happened to me not long after I moved into my new commune.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before I slept. I placed my phone next to my head like I usually
              do and switched on my alarm clock for the next day around 7am.
              Without a second minute of thought, I passed out.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am generally a still person. When I sleep, I'm mostly on my
              back. That night was weird though. While I was sleeping I must
              have twisted my hand in a funny position so that my left hand was
              hanging lifelessly above my head. As all night sleeps turns out,
              the sleep passes by quick but the time laps was actually really
              long.
            </p>

            <p>
              So around 4am I heard a loud thumb on my bed. I forgot to mention
              that I do not sleep on mattresses and that's where the loud thumb
              came from. With the thumb, I also felt my left shoulder move. So I
              presumed that that must have been my left arm.
            </p>

            <p>
              This was when things started to become slightly peculiar. I was
              still slightly half asleep when I felt a hand resting on my left
              shoulder on the front. So I reached over to this object that felt
              like a hand with my right hand. I could feel that it was soft and
              cold as I carefully pinched it. It felt very familiar … My brain
              suddenly registered. The only thing my brain could register it as
              was a dead hand. I woke up thinking to myself that a dead hand was
              lying on my shoulder. was it a dead hand? Whose hand was it?
            </p>
            <p>"Keep calm"</p>

            <p>"It’s not moving"</p>

            <p>
              My heart was pumping really quickly. I turned my head. Grabbed my
              phone. Switch on the torch. Shinned on "this" thing. It’s a hand!
            </p>

            <p>… it was my hand…</p>

            <p>
              The nerves in my brain was switched on now that I am wide awake.
              Pulses started trickle down my left arm. I was able to control my
              left hand again. Fingers were numb for a long time as I closed my
              fingers into a fist and release again.
            </p>
            <h3>The thoughts</h3>
            <p>
              I am fortune to understand how it feels to completely loose an
              arm. I could still picture this arm as a dead weight hanging onto
              my shoulder. My brain did not register that I was actually just
              touching my own hand. It was completely disjointed by the nerves.
              This body surely does not belong to me. I don’t own this body. I
              am merely borrowing it to fulfil my purpose in life.
            </p>

            <p>
              So when I know that not even this body belongs to me … what more
              was there to be attached to? What more was there to be greedy
              about? What more was there to be selfish about? What more was
              there to fight for? What was the Meaning of Life now that not even
              our bodies truly exist?
            </p>
