            <h3>The adventure</h3>
            <p>Springing up from my sleeping position, it came back …</p>
            <p>Tonight was such a confusing night …</p>
            <p>
              Sitting on the steps to my bed, I waited for my blue chargeable
              hot water bottle to warm up before I went to bed. I was thinking
              about the beautiful songs that my friends were singing during the
              night and how well they sang. I looked at the clock and it was
              11:00pm already.
            </p>
            <p>
              I climbed into bed hugging the warm water bottle that I used for
              my second time so far. I placed the pillow aside and stretched out
              my neck. My dad use to tell me that is really good for my neck
              because I have a habit of leaning forward when I type too long on
              the computer. I swallowed a couple gulps of saliva, but it was
              getting difficult. I realised that my neck was finding it hard to
              adjust. A couple of minutes later when this was getting slightly
              uncomfortable, I decided to get my pillow back and sleep normally…
              So there I was … out.
            </p>
            <p>
              I semi woke up on my left side and felt my arm being seriously
              dead so I decided to sleep on my back. I carried on sleeping.
            </p>
            <p>
              Slowly but surely, with the uncomfortable blanket pushing against
              my throat, I started moving my left hand around to feel my neck
              and my other arm. Something was troubling me and I couldn’t get to
              sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
              My neck felt very foreign … my right arm felt very foreign … Wait
              a second, my left hand felt foreign. It didn’t feel like it was my
              own hand but I still had control over it. Moving it around and
              feeling things. My left hand was warm and soft but again … it felt
              like a dead person’s body that I am feeling where this dead body
              was recently murdered. Like it happened 2 minutes ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              Picking this signal up and remembering the horrible feeling of
              having a disjointed arm in my previous experience, I jumped up
              straight away and started moving my hand around to keep my blood
              and nerves moving. I was awake. I did not want to have the feeling
              of losing an arm again. I lay down in bed again after sitting up.
              I felt my left arm and it was ice cold. I felt my right arm and it
              was body temperature. I started feeling the trickles starting
              again. I sat up. This is somewhat disturbing me. May I please
              sleep without having to be terrified about losing a limb please?
            </p>
            <p>
              Sigh … I sat up again with each arm hugging the other arm and fell
              asleep for a minute in the up-right sitting position. I was tired.
              This wasn’t working.
            </p>
            <p>
              I climbed off bed with a slight fear. I switched on the lights. It
              was 12:30AM.
            </p>
            <h2>My thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              I can finally understand how some people have a fear of sleeping
              where they have to go to sleep with a sense of fear stuck in the
              middle of their heart. It’s not about the sleep, but more about
              what happens during the sleep. What happens when you’re in a state
              where you cannot control? Sometimes it feels as if you are
              possessed and you fight a battle against an unknown force in order
              to gain control of your body. And the questions is "Will something
              happen to me during this time?" Will I still have my left arm by
              the time I wake up? If I do end up losing my body, am I willing to
              give it up now? Am I doing what I am supposed to with the given
              life span of my life? Am I having too much fun to the extent that
              I forget what my priority is?
            </p>
            <p>
              And the last question that I am still busy asking myself now as I
              type this out … Do I still have the will power to climb back into
              bed? My left arm is still cold …
            </p>
            <p>
              Seated on this hard surfaced chair thinking about how I need to
              wake up to get to work at 6:30AM …
            </p>
            <p>Anyway, have a lovely night ^_^</p>
            <p>
              I am sure this ocean will let me know the meaning of life once I
              am ready for it…
            </p>
