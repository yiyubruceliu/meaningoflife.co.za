            <h3>The adventure</h3>

            <p>
              It all started when I was on my way to the bathroom and I decided
              to stop halfway when I saw this pretty girl sitting on the bench.
              It was quite a comfortable looking bench. I don’t even know what I
              was thinking … probably wasn’t thinking about anything. She was
              busy playing around on her phone when I marched up to her and sat
              right next to her on the bench. Could I say that I am quite glad
              my brain switches off sometimes for me to have these brave moments
              in my life.
            </p>

            <p>
              For the purpose of this story, I am gonna call this girl Ira. I’ve
              already seen Ira quite a few times walking up and down. Just like
              my previous post "The whatsapp status", there was something that
              drives this spark between us. What I have realised is that
              sometimes, this spark never lets you know if it will go on and
              become a fire or will it die out after a few seconds of light. You
              kinda need to just check it out and see how far it takes you.
              Sometimes, the two of you are meant to be together, but not right
              now. Why would I say all this? Well, this is what happened.
            </p>

            <p>
              The moment I sat down, she greeted me. She was quite friendly to
              me because we already have had quite a few awkward smiles with
              each other so we kinda acknowledge the existence of the other
              person. We started chatting and suddenly, I remembered this one
              Ted talk I watched on YouTube about big talk. It was a brilliant
              Ted talk that outlined the method of eliminating small talk and
              just getting into the important stuff in life. You can watch the
              video below:
            </p>
            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
              <iframe
                max-width="560"
                max-height="315"
                class="embed-responsive-item thumbnail"
                src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WDbxqM4Oy1Y"

            </div>
            <p>
              So from gathering knowledge from that video, I said to her "what
              is your deepest fear?" so she hesitated for a minute or two
              thinking to herself "what is actually my deepest fear?"<br />
              She repeated herself a couple of times "what is my deepest fear"
              with a frown on her face. She came to a conclusion and told me
              that her deepest fear is sleeping. She always prays before going
              to bed. This felt very familiar to because I felt the same thing
              before. If you want to know what I felt, you can read "Revisit of
              the Numb Hand". So I shared her my experience with regards to that
              story and we kind of apprehended emotionally with each other
              because we understood the feeling. Funny enough, there is this
              thing with conversation specialists called "building rapport"
              which is exactly what I did.
            </p>

            <p>
              We ended up drifting to a conversation about religion and belief.
              This was fantastic in the sense that we could get over the small
              talk as soon as possible and get into the things that really
              matter in life. She had a strong faith in her belief which was a
              very attractive characteristic to me. I kind of dittoed her on
              that regards. It seemed at the moment that we had a lot in common,
              but again, how big will the fire burn?
            </p>

            <p>
              My short toilet break slowly became an hour chat. This interaction
              was just too fantastic for a toilet break. I really didn’t want to
              leave. But… I think that was the most we got to know each other.
            </p>

            <h3>After story</h3>

            <p>
              When we saw each other again, things changed. We didn’t build
              rapport so well with each other anymore. We had nothing else in
              common. We didn’t have the same interests. She loved reading, I
              didn’t. I loved star signs, she didn’t. There was nothing pulling
              us together anymore. I was scared I am gonna come off as trying to
              convert her if we start the topic on beliefs again. We got busy
              with our own lives and slowly drifted apart. Short and sweet.
            </p>

            <h3>My thoughts</h3>

            <p>
              Sometimes we don’t know how long a particular friendship,
              relationship or family-ship will last. When we get to know
              someone, and we connect on a deeper lever than we normally do with
              others, it doesn’t mean that it will end up being like that
              forever. When the fire died, it doesn’t mean it will forever be
              dead. But we have no idea what is the chances of that fire
              reigniting again. Sometimes, I feel like there is something out
              there that is toying with our emotions.
            </p>

            <p>
              I personally don’t think being detached to people is the final
              answer. However, when we come in contact with a person and this
              fire is flaming with warmness, all of a sudden … the fire dies…
              how much we want that fire to be alive again is intense. It
              becomes really cold. So at this moment in time, are we able to let
              go? … Are we able to start from the beginning again and act like
              the fire has never started before? Especially when you come in
              contact with the person once in a while?
            </p>

            <p>
              This is a very similar concept with people who started off very
              poor in their childhood and they found a way to earn lots of
              money. Once they got themselves up the ladder of billionaires and
              making it rain with cash, and then suddenly have nothing left.
              Would these people be able to deal with the massive change? Or
              would they commit suicide like how a large portion of them did?
              This video link shows it all:
            </p>
            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
              <iframe
                max-width="560"
                max-height="315"
                class="embed-responsive-item thumbnail"
                src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MqPF5cc8CkI"
                frameborder="0"

              ></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>
              And here is what I think. In life, there isn’t much that we cannot
              do or get attached to, we just need to be able to be prepared to
              let go of it if one day we end up not having it anymore. So the
              only reason why some people would try their best not to get any of
              these attachments is because they are afraid that they won’t be an
              able to let go the moment they start. Some easy examples are like
              the only cup of alcohol tonight, the only cigarette for the day,
              the only cup of coffee for the day, the only packet of chocolate
              for the day, the only pack of coke that I will smoke today.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am sure this ocean will let me know the meaning of life once I
              am ready for it…
